PREREQUISITES:

- Python 3.x must be installed on the machine
- PHP 3.3.11 or higher must be installed IN THE PROJECT DIRECTORY
- Tested with Windows 10 build 1803

RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:

- Open a Powershell/Bash command shell
- At root level, clone the Git repo with "git clone [theRepoURL]"
- Navigate to folder "travail-4-alchimyk"
- Install Python dependancies (surprise!, there are Python dependancies!!) by typing the following command: "pip install -r requirements.txt"
  (there's too many of them, I know, but I was feeling lazy)
- From root/travail-4-alchimyk, launch the PHP server by typing "php -S localhost:5000 (or whatever is your favourite TCP port, you won't be judged for that as we are
  very inclusive developers), and press Enter
- The server should indicate it's on  -> if not, do just like everybody and search Google!

The app will be available at https://localhost:5000 (or any of your other kinky port choice, you nasty boy!) via your favorite internet browser

Again, friendly reminder:  Don't screw your future by sticking to whatever-the-fuck your horoscope says, we all know it's bullshit.
